Assignment provided by ECGR 3180 (Data Structures and Algorithms in C++)

Add a copy constructor for the linked list implementation below.  Upload list.cpp with your code added. 
list.cpp

Use the following header file, and test program to verify that the copy constructor works correctly. That is, modifying the copied list, does not modify the original test or header file.

list.h 

list_test.cpp
